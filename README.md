🚀 Project Overview

The Email Spam Classifier is a Machine Learning-based system that automatically classifies messages as Spam 🚨 or Ham ✅ using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

It analyzes the content of messages, extracts meaningful patterns, and predicts whether the message is spam. The project also includes an interactive web application built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

🎯 Objectives
Detect spam messages automatically
Apply NLP techniques for text processing
Train and evaluate multiple ML models
Provide a real-time user interface for prediction

✨ Features
🔹 Core Features
✔️ Spam vs Ham classification
✔️ Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
✔️ TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams
✔️ Feature engineering (text length, word count, sentence count)

🔹 Machine Learning Features
✔️ Multiple models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
✔️ Model comparison (Accuracy & Precision)
✔️ Confusion Matrix visualization
✔️ Reduced false positives & false negatives

🔹 Model Management
✔️ Model saving using model.pkl
✔️ Vectorizer saving using vectorizer.pkl
✔️ Fast loading without retraining

🔹 Web Application Features
✔️ Interactive UI using Streamlit
✔️ Real-time spam detection
✔️ Instant prediction output
✔️ Confidence score display

🔹 Visualization
✔️ WordCloud for spam keywords
✔️ Data distribution graphs
